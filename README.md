# Random Quote - ES6 -- with browser-sync

A simple Angular 4 web application that displays a random quote on the page.(seed example)

To work on this project:

* Run `npm run ib` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run pd` to compile the ES6 code in the `./asserts/` folder into ES5 code into the `./pjdist/` folder and get product min js file.
* Run `npm run dev` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/). when modified files, browser would be reloaded.

The ** Angular 4 ** seed.
